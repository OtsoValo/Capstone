This project will use natural language processing in order to predict the likelihood that a tweet will be re-tweeted.  This is in the context of the Canadian federal election that took place on October 19, 2015.  This year, there was an unprecedented public interest in the election outcome.  Citizens, news organizations and political actors took to twitter in order to express their views on a range of hot button topics related to the campaign platform of the Conservative, Liberal and New Democratic Parties.  Which tweets are most likely to be re-tweeted?  Is this correlated with the topics that are most important to voters?  Which algorithms are most useful in analyzing text data for predictive purposes?  Such analysis is useful because it allows those invested in the political process to have a real-time gauge of public response to political positions announced by politicians on various issues.  Sentiment can be understood by geography (given geo-tagged data from Twitter), or other user  identifiers.  Based on such analysis, politicians can choose to adjust campaign positions to target certain segments of voters.  

Key research questions include (i) Can twitter topic analysis be used in order to predict the retweet frequency of a given tweet? (ii) Which topics were most heavily retweeted? iii) Which algorithms are most useful in classifying text data?
